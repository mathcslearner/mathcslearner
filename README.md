## Hi there 👋

Hi, my name is Ming Zhe and I'm an Honours Math student at the University of Waterloo, originally from Montreal, QC.

I'm passionate about mathematics, data, software and machine learning, especially how these fields intersect together to drive modern technology systems. 

- I'm currently working on: A data analytics platform for soccer clubs

- I'm currently learning about: Supervised Machine Learning, Spring Boot

- I want to learn more about: Interpreters, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing

I am currently seeking Summer 2026 internships, and I am eager to get involved and gain hands-on experience in roles related to mathematics, software engineering/full-stack development or data analysis.
